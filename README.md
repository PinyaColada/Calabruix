## Deck-chess

A chess engine for a deck-chess variation, the deck-chess variation it can transpose to a big number of chess variants.

The deck chess variation it makes you create:
* Any regular style piece such as the chancellor or the archbishop
* Inmortal pieces such as the duch
* Pieces unable to capture like the frog

This is a personal project that it will be used in my thesis
